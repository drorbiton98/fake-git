Just want to clarify:

it's obviously starts with the modules, after them there is a slight edit to the dircmp module and a few errors i created.
from there to about halfway it's start with assisting funcs.
the actual code start with the func init, and please note, if you don't start with running init for your folder, and creating that '.wit' folder,
you'll never be able to start playing with the code.

therefore it is necessery to start with the init function.
also, please take a look on how the system chooses what function to start with, i'm sorry i didn't mentiond inside i was too lazy (:P) but here is a quick summery:
if it has sys.argv[2] as var, it means if you run from CMD you'll need to put the right input for it to work.

add - takes a path to a file or directory
commit - takes a string
checkout - takes either a name of a branch you've created or a image folder name
branch - takes a string

good luck i guess.. !
